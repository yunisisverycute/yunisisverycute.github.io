**zaza**.

The one and only.

It's my **savior**.

No one knows about it.

But what I see.

Can differ.

Only I am the one who knows.

The true power of zaza.

When the janitor asks for some.

I look at him **intrestingly**.

Knowing I will give him some.

**Generosity**.

It's need for life.

It's needed for zaza.

It's needed for **me**.
