Me.

You can find me at school.

In the janitors closet.

With zaza.

Doing what I do best.

Doing what I can.

Doing what I **need**.

But what if.

There was no closet.

And I was all alone.

All by myself.

With zaza.

Feeling like a deformed zebra on steriods.

How will I function?

How will it be?

Will I be glad?

Will I be sad?

What if i'm not a deformed zebra on steriods?

What if I am a normal person.

With zaza.

Thats having fun.

But no.

You can find me.

In the closet.

All alone.

With **zaza**.
